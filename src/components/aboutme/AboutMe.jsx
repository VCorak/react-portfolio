                        And here I am, writing my first portfolio in React, have 20+ projects and exercises behind me and group of people who were there for me when it was "I can never center a div, I give up" moment.
                        <span> Love running, woods and baking cakes. Chocolate cakes. </span>
                        </p>
                </div>
                </div>
                <a href="#projects">
                    <img src="assets/down.png" alt="down arrow" />
                </a>
            </div>
